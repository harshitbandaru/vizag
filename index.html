            <h2>Why Vizag is known as the city of destiny</h2>
            <p>Visakhapatnam, also known as Vizag, is called the "City of Destiny" for a number of reasons, including:
                The city's name is inspired by the Hindu god of courage, Visakha. The phrase "destiny favors the brave" is said to be the reason for the city's nickname.
